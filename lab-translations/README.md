# Intro on Translating labs



E.g instead of using Nano editor to replace the below h1 header, Add text like this, annd replace YOUR_NAME with your name

```
sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
```

The code version would look like, using regex expressions to match the above HTML page

```
sudo sed 's/<h1>.*<\/h1>/\n Hi from Peter/' /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html

```


## To ping an IP

We can use curl 

```bash
ping my-vm-1
```
Using Gcloud Shell

```
# Read the name of the IP address by executing  the following command
gcloud compute instances list
```


## More examples

In the Cloud Shell create an environment variable that contains the full email address of Username 2.

```
export USER2=[USERNAME_2_EMAIL]
```

Example (Do not copy):

```
export USER2=gcpstaginguser68_student@qwiklabs.net
```

In the Cloud Shell use sed to replace the placeholder in the file with the value of the environment variable.

```
sed -i "s/\[USERNAME_2_EMAIL\]/${USER2}/" username2-editor-binding.yaml
```

In the Cloud Shell, execute the following command to confirm that the correct change has been made:

```
cat username2-editor-binding.yaml
```

The subjects section should now look similar to the following.

Example (Do not copy):
```
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: gcpstaginguser68_student@qwiklabs.net
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

You will apply this RoleBinding later.          Create a Dockerfile under the microservices-demo directory and add the configuration to the file. Copy the given codes from the lab page to the following snippet, and then run the commands in the Cloud Shell.
```
cd microservices-demo

cat > Dockerfile <<EOF
   
// COPY TO HERE
   
EOF
``` Build the image with the following command:

docker build -t microservices-demo:v0.0.1 .
Run docker images to look at the images you built.

Before clicking Check my progress in the lab page, donâ€™t forget to run the following commands to execute the marking script:

cd ~/marking
./step1.shDownload and install skaffold:

curl -Lo skaffold https://storage.googleapis.com/skaffold/releases/v0.36.0/skaffold-linux-amd64 && chmod +x skaffold && sudo mv skaffold /usr/local/bin

Get the external IP of the application:

export EXTERNAL_IP=$(kubectl get service frontend-external | awk 'BEGIN { cnt=0; } { cnt+=1; if (cnt > 1) print $4; }')
Finally, confirm that the app is up and running:

curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}\n"  http://$EXTERNAL_IP
